This script downloads files from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip","wearable".

Relevant files are read such as:
- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

Each test subject is matched with the activities undertaken, and each trainer is matched with the training activities.

The two datasets with training data and test data are merged into one dataframe.

The relevant columns are extracted which are:

-"id": a unique identifier for each of the participants in the excercise
"subject": whether the subject is a candidate(test-taker), or trainer
"meanX": mean for the X axis
"meanY": mean for the Y axis
"meanZ": mean for the Z axis
"stdX": standard deviation for the X axis
"stdY": standard deviation for the Y axis 
"stdZ": standard deviation for the Z axis
"activity": the type of activity being recorded.

A new table is created that summarises the mean and standard deviation on each activity for each subject.
